# Regression Analysis Project

- In this project I'm using Python's Statsmodels library to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) based on various health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, weight, and smoking habits.

- The analysis tries to identify the biggest factors affecting SBP and develop predictive models using both linear and logistic regression.
